# RPS Game

> The Goal of this project is to create a Rock-Paper-Scissors game that reads the player's hand sign in play.

## Milestone 1

- I began by setting up a GitHub repo.

## Milestone 2

- For this milestone, I created a machine learning model that can read one of three hand signs - "rock", "paper", or "scissors" (or "nothing"). I did this through google's accessible "teachable machine" web-based tool.

## Milestone 3
